# 💻 Simple Python Banking System 🏦

I built this Python banking system to understand how basic financial transactions work — like deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks. It was a personal project to practice real-world logic using simple tools.

## ❓ Why I Built It

I wanted to apply my programming skills to something practical. Simulating how money 💸 moves in and out of an account helped me think like a developer 👨‍💻, not just a coder.

- Stopping negative deposits 🚫
- Blocking withdrawals beyond the balance ❗

Debugging taught me how to make programs both logical and user-friendly ✅.
